Today's Kata calls for us to use regex to review potential pin codes and mark them as valid/true or invalid/false based on whether they contain only digits and are 4 or 6 characters in length.

I drew out some possible solutions.  The digits-only restriction was straightforward, but the lengths of 4 or 6 (but not 5) required some significant googling.
