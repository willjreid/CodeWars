Today's Kata calls for us to use regex to review potential user names and mark them as valid/true or invalid/flase.

Matt L and I whiteboarded the solution.  We quickly determined the filtering we would need to achieve the solution, then spent time reviewing the regex docs to make sure we have the right notation to ensure both aspects of filter logic applied.
