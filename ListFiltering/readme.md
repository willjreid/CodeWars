In this Kata, we are asked to write a function that will take in a list of non-negative integers and strings, and return a new list with the strings filtered out (only show the integers).

Verify that which contents are numbers using isNan, then push the TRUE results into a new array.

The Kata is available at https://www.codewars.com/kata/list-filtering/train/javascript
