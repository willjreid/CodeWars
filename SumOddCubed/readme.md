In this Kata we are asked to take in an array of integers and return a value which is the computed some of all odd numbers after the values in the initial array are cubed.  

We whiteboarded a solution that uses the map function to make a copy of the original array with the values cubed, then uses the reduce function to add the values together if they are add.  Incidentally, the indices of the initial values which are odd will match the indices of the cubed values which are odd--only an odd number cubed can yield an odd number.
