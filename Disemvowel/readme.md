This kata asks us to remove all vowels from a string.  

Matt I and I whiteboarded a pair of solutions.  We could split the string into an array, loop through the array and look for each vowel and remove it with a pop() method, then join it back together.  OR you could just use the .replace() method to look for vowels and replace them with ''.  As a bonus, you can use Regex and solve it in one line.
