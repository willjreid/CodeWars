Today's Kata calls for us to add a dash between characters in a multi-digit number only if there are two odd numbers in a row.

Matt and I whiteboarded a fairly complex solution involving converting the number to a string to an array, then running IF logic on the array, then converting it back to a string and removing the commas.
