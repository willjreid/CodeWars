Today's Kata was straightforward: use the replace() method to change all dots within a string to dashes.  The trick is that dots are ready as a reference to all characters.  You must escape the normal dot functionality with a backslash, and add a "g" to ensure the replace() method runs across the whole string instead of just the first instance of a "." in the string.
