Today's Kata calls for us to reorder three items in an array from index 2 to index 1 to index 0.

Andrew and I whiteboarded to talk through the solution.  We initially conceived of a moderately complex solution that involved slicing out individual elements of the initial array and unshifting them back into the array in the new order.  That solution is a bit more complex, and involves stringifying the output items.

The simplest solution is right there in the problem domain: return the contents of an array in the order [2], [1], [0].
